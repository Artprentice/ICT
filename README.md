# ICT
This is a site required by Michael. The inner circle trader.  Who posted an online contest as to who can meet his requirements 
The requirements:

Home page with a dynamic nightscape of a city... motion graphics preferred.

No logo please.
No image of me.

The wording I have on my present homepage is a good starting point for now...

I only need 3 pages apart from the homepage...

1)  Present Lecture
Where I can share something publicly... in chart and text.

2)  Your Stories
Where I make public you as my student & the accomplishments you achieved studying under me.

3)  ICT Compendium
My YouTube playlists

While i was pressed for time, so far ive got the homepage down( somewhat ).
